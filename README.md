This project was to practice with display and subfiles in the ibm i system. I created an order system in which a user can come on, 
look at the existing orders and make any changes needed. It will then update the necessary tables. 

Project covered the following concepts: 

- Subfiles
- Display files
- RPGLE Free Format
- SQL (Embedded)
